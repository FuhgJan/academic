Hi! Iâ€™m Jan, an Assistant Professor at The University of Texas at Austin, Austin in the Department of Aerospace Engineering & Engineering Mechanics. 

The focus of my work lies in the intersection between computational physics and machine learning. 

I have a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Cornell University. 
I have an M.Sc. and a B.Sc. in Computational Engineering from the Leibniz University Hannover, Germany. 





## Updates

  * We have a new preprint out on modeling thermoelasticity materials with machine learning while ensuring polyconvexity. It can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15562)
    
  * Our recent preprint about physics-informed data-driven constitutive modeling for viscoelastic materials can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13897.pdf)

  * We recently released a preprint where we introduce the Deep Convolutional Ritz Method (DCRM) as a parametric PDE solver. For more information follow this [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04675.pdf)

## Open positions
Multiple fully funded Ph.D. positions are available in my research group in Spring/Fall of 2025. The positions will be broadly in the area of physics-informed machine learning, computational mechanics, and computational statistics. Highly motivated students with Bachelor's or Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, or other relevant fields are encouraged to send me an email at <jan.fuhg@utexas.edu>. Please include your CV and (preliminary) transcripts.
