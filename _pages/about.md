Hi! Iâ€™m Jan, an incoming Assistant Professor at The University of Texas at Austin, Austin in the Department of Aerospace Engineering & Engineering Mechanics. 

The focus of my work lies in the intersection between computational physics and machine learning. 





## Updates

  * 04/2023 - I am joining the Department of Aerospace Engineering & Engineering Mechanics at UT Austin as an Assistant Professor in January 2024.
    
  * Our recent preprint about physics-informed data-driven constitutive modeling for viscoelastic materials can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13897.pdf)

  * We recently released a preprint where we introduce the Deep Convolutional Ritz Method (DCRM) as a parametric PDE solver. For more information follow this [link] ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13897.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04675.pdf)https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04675.pdf)
