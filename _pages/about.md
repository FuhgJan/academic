Hi! Iâ€™m Jan, an incoming Assistant Professor at The University of Texas at Austin, Austin in the Department of Aerospace Engineering & Engineering Mechanics. 

The focus of my work lies in the intersection between computational physics and machine learning. 

I am finishing my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering advised by Prof. Nikolaos Bouklas at Cornell University. 
I have an M.Sc. and a B.Sc. in Computational Engineering from the Leibniz University Hannover, Germany. 





## Updates

  * 04/2023 - I am joining the Department of Aerospace Engineering & Engineering Mechanics at UT Austin as an Assistant Professor in January 2024.
    
  * Our recent preprint about physics-informed data-driven constitutive modeling for viscoelastic materials can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13897.pdf)

  * We recently released a preprint where we introduce the Deep Convolutional Ritz Method (DCRM) as a parametric PDE solver. For more information follow this [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.04675.pdf)

## Open positions
Multiple fully funded Ph.D. positions are available in my research group starting in Fall of 2024. The positions will be broadly in the area of physics-informed machine learning, computational mechanics, and computational statistics. Highly motivated students with Bachelor's or Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, or other relevant fields are encouraged to send me an email at <jan.fuhg@utexas.edu>. Please include your CV and (preliminary) transcripts.
